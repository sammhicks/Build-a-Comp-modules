# Build-a-Comp Modules
The UoB Build-a-Comp modules implemented in Logisim

To import the modules, go to the above url, download the module, then in Logisim, click on "Project", then "Load Library", then on "Logisim Library..."

As far as I'm aware, they behave identically to the physical modules, but I'm not making any promises. If you do find a discrepency, please let me know so that I can fix the fault.

For some reason, moving modules around sometimes causes the Logisim to disable simulation. If you re-enable the simulation once you've finished then it works again.
